## Background
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. A flood is essentially the accumulation of water over normally dry land. There are 3 common types of floods, namely flash floods, coastal floods, and river floods. Flash floods are caused by rapid and excessive rainfall that raises water heights quickly, and rivers, streams, channels or roads may be overtaken. River floods, on the other hand, are caused when consistent rain or snow melting forces a river to exceed capacity whereas coastal floods are caused by storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and tsunamis.

Often, the inappropriate ways in which waterways are managed, coupled with the alterations that are made to land play a significant role in flooding. Increasingly, flooding factors are also linked to climate change. Floods can cause widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damage to personal property and critical public health infrastructure. Between 1998 and 2017, floods affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. People who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings are mostly affected by floods. Furthermore, areas which lack warning systems and awareness of flooding hazards, are most vulnerable to floods.

## Flood Situation in Kampala
In Africa, the city of Kampala in Uganda with a current population of 3.5 million people, is one of the urban areas that face frequent flash flooding events in each rain season. This is mainly due to unregulated urban development in flood prone areas, climate change, and poor management of drainage systems and solid waste ( Douglas et al., 2008; Sliuzas, 2012). These flooding events have caused significant damage to infrastructure, loss of life, environmental destruction and disruption to economic activities.

## Existing Flood Control Methods
Currently, the following approaches are employed to address the flooding problem in Kampala:

• Manual Observation and Data Collection: Local meteorological departments and disaster management authorities rely on rainfall data collected from weather stations.

• Community-Based Early Warning: Local communities in flood-prone areas sometimes use traditional knowledge to predict flooding based on weather patterns.

• Drainage Improvement Projects: Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has implemented drainage improvement projects to reduce the likelihood of flooding.

• Satellite Imagery and Remote Sensing: Some projects use satellite data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map flood-prone areas.

## Limitations of Flood Control Methods

• Manual Observation and Data Collection: However, this method is limited by its lack of real-time data, accuracy, and coverage.

• Community-Based Early Warning: While useful, this approach is informal, lacks scientific precision, and is not always reliable.

• Drainage Improvement Projects: However, these measures address only long-term infrastructural issues and do not provide early warnings.

• Satellite Imagery and Remote Sensing: While promising, these systems are expensive and rely heavily on data processing, which may delay warnings.

## Flooding in Kampala is significant due to several reasons

• Public Safety: The recurrent floods pose a direct risk to human life, particularly in informal settlements.

• Economic Disruption: Floods damage roads, homes, and businesses, leading to significant economic losses.

• Health Risks: Floodwaters often carry pollutants and lead to outbreaks of waterborne diseases like cholera.

• Urban Planning Challenges: The lack of an effective drainage system and uncontrolled urbanization exacerbate the flood risk.

## Contribution to Engineering
The design of a Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) for Kampala would significantly contribute to the field of engineering by combining multiple disciplines such as hydrological modeling and data analysis. The system would utilize open-source data to integrate real-time rainfall and water level monitoring with predictive models, using machine learning algorithms to predict flood events.

This approach would advance the field in the following ways:

• Improved Infrastructure Planning: Engineers can use predictive data to design infrastructure, which is more resilient to flooding.

• Innovative Use of Technology: Leveraging IoT sensors and machine learning would demonstrate how modern technologies can enhance traditional civil engineering solutions.

• Timely Alerts: Communities can be alerted of oncoming floods, allowing residents to move to safer places.Thus,lowering casualties and mitigating health concerns associated with waterborne infections caused by exposure to contaminated water.

## Machine Learning Model:
Deep learning model will be incorporated to forecast flooding, which is used for analyzing large set of hydrological, environmental data. An input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer are the standard layers of a deep learning model.

## Project Statement:
Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) will be Incorportated, which is critical for predicting and monitoring in real time, allowing for timely alerts about vulnerable areas to authorities, thereby protecting the citizens, infrastructure and economic stability.
